                        As part of the masterâ€™s course, we did group work as a transdisciplinary case study for the World Waternet Amsterdam
                        project. The project was about "Decreasing Water Demand via Water Conservation and Water Demand Management
                        Measures in Nairobi, Kenya." It was a successful project full of practical recommendations to tackle the problem of water
                        scarcity in Nairobi, Kenya.
